    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>May 22 - May 28</p>
        <p>
        <b>What did you do last week?</b>
            <br>
        Nothing! Its week 1.
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        This week I've planned out my project proposal and set up my personal website. I also created 3 HTML files to make my website look nice!
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
        Not this week.
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
        I had to refresh my memory on HTML, I'll be better prepared for next weeks update on my website.
        </p>

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>May 29 - June 4</p>
        <p>
        <b>What did you do last week?</b>
            <br>
        I finalized my project idea, posted my proposal in Piazza and created a personal website.
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to complete the first two sections of my Java course (listed below) and set up my coding environment.
        <blockquote>
            1. Introduction, Installation and Environment Setup [51m]  
            <br>
            2. Basic Constructs of Java Programming [1hr 16m]
        </blockquote>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
        Time. I am in another class this semester that has a long first lab due and and exam next week, I'm hoping to carve out time to focus on this project before the weekend.
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
        I decided to use VS Code instead of a basic text editor for my HTML updates - it is much more efficient. 
        </p>

    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <p>June 5 - June 11</p>
        <p>
        <b>What did you do last week?</b>
            <br>
        I completed the first two sections of my Java course and set up my coding environment (IntelliJ IDEA).
        <blockquote>
                1. Introduction, Installation and Environment Setup [51m]  
                <br>
                2. Basic Constructs of Java Programming [1hr 16m]
        </blockquote>

        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to complete the next two sections of my Java course.
        <blockquote>
                3. Object and Classes [43m]
                <br>
                4. Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation [1hr 26m]
        </blockquote>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
        Time again, my other course is proving to be exteremely time consuming. I'm currently on track to completeing 2 sections a week, will adjust if needed.
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
        I split up my Java lectures throughout last week, which caused me to bounce back and forth between class assignments. I'm going to try to work on one class at a time this week to see how that impacts my ability to stay organized and improve time management. 
        </p>

    <h2>Week 4 </h2>
    <p>June 12 - June 18</p>
        <p>
        <b>What did you do last week?</b>
            <br>
        I completed the following two sections of my Java course.
        <blockquote>
                3. Object and Classes [43m]  
                <br>
                4. Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation [1hr 26m]
        </blockquote>

        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to complete the next two sections of my Java course.
        <blockquote>
                5. Array, Static, Final, Interface [1hr 17m]
                <br>
                6. Wrapper Class, String, StringBuilder, Access Modifier [1hr 27m]
        </blockquote>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
        Time, but I have found 2 sections a week to be a manageable pace. 
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
        I saved my lectures for the weekend last week and I think I will continue to work on this schedule, it allowed me to complete both sections in one sitting rather than split throughout the week.
        </p>

    <h2>Week 5 </h2>
    <p>June 19 - June 25</p>
    <p>
        <b>What did you do last week?</b>
            <br>
        I completed the following section of my Java course.
        <blockquote>
                5. Array, Static, Final, Interface [1hr 17m] 
        </blockquote>

        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to complete the next sections of my Java course that I didn't get to last week.
        <blockquote>
                6. Wrapper Class, String, StringBuilder, Access Modifier [1hr 27m]
        </blockquote>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
        Time. Last week was the first week that I wasn't able to complete two sections, with an exam and a long lab upcoming in my other class I'm anticipating this week will be similar.  
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
            I plan to complete one section this week to accommodate for the increase in time spent in my other course. I will attempt 2 courses again next week. 
        </p>

        <blockquote>
                6. Wrapper Class, String, StringBuilder, Access Modifier [1hr 27m]
        </blockquote>
        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to complete the next few sections of my Java course.
        <blockquote>
                7. Collection Framework and Generics [52m]
            <br>
                8. Exception and Exception Handling [55m]        
        </blockquote>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
            Time will continue to be an issue but I feel confident that I will remain on track to begin my project in the next few weeks. 
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
            Last week was a longer section than the last 4 on my list, I'm planning to take advantage of that and continue to complete 2 sections a week.
        </p>

    <h2>Week 7 </h2>
    <p>July 3 - July 9</p>
    <p>
        <b>What did you do last week?</b>

        <br>
            8. Exception and Exception Handling [55m]        
        </blockquote>
        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to complete the last two sections of my Java course before the capstone project.
        <blockquote>
                9. Multithreading, Synchronization, and Garbage Collection [33m]
            <br>
                10. File Handling, Serialization and Deserialization [39m]     
            </blockquote>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
            Not at the moment, I'm currently on track to begin my capstone project next week.
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
            I'm continuing to refine my time management skills but I feel that I've found a consistent work pattern that works for me.

        </blockquote>
        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to review my capstone project and create a schedule for completing the work over the next few weeks of class.   
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
            No.

    <h2>Week 9 </h2>
    <p>July 17 - July 23</p>
    <b>What did you do last week?</b>
        <br>
        I reviewed my capstone projet overview, this project consists of creating a bookstore application for authors and customers to buy and sell books.
        I created a sequence diagram and class diagram to organize the classes, functions, and code needed for this application.
        I also updated my website with project information, see my <a href="https://maes2069.github.io/menu/capstone.html">Capstone Project</a> page for details. 
            <br>
            <br>

    <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
        <br>  
        I plan to begin writing code for my project, which will include creating all of the Packages and Classes needed.
        <br>
        <br>

    <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
        <br>
        No.

        <br>
    
    <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
        <br>    
        After reviewing the scope of the project, I am confident that I can split up the work needed between the last few weeks of class. 
    </p>
        
    <hr>
    <h2>Week 10 </h2>
    <p>July 24 - July 30</p>
    <b>What did you do last week?</b>
    <br>
        I began writing code for my project, which included creating all of the Packages and Classes needed based on the sequence and class diagrams created last week.
        <br>
        <br>

    <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
        <br>  
        I plan to continue writing code for my bookstore app.
        <br>
        <br>

    <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
        <br>
        No.
        <br>
        <br>

    <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
        <br>    
        Going through the classes and packages last week took less time than I anticipated, this puts me in a good position to complete the capstone project this week or next. 
    </p>
        
    <hr>
    <h2>Week 11 </h2>
    <p>July 31 - Aug 6</p>
    <b>What did you do last week?</b>
    <br>
        I continued to write code for my capstone project, I was able to complete many of the functions needed to add a new book and review the book details.
        <br>
        <br>

    <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
        <br>  
        I plan to add finishing touches to my Bookstore App and complete the capstone project.
        <br>
        <br>

    <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
        <br>
        Nope.
        <br>
        <br>

    <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
        <br>   
        Going through the instructional videos for how to execute the project's code, I'm finding that the actual implementation of an entire application is more complex 
        than just understanding the basics of the language. I appreciate that this course included a real life application for using Java.

    <h2>Week 12</h2>
