    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>May 22 - May 28</p>
        <p>
        <b>What did you do last week?</b>
            <br>
        Nothing! Its week 1.
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        This week I've planned out my project proposal and set up my personal website. I also created 3 HTML files to make my website look nice!
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
        Not this week.
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
        I had to refresh my memory on HTML, I'll be better prepared for next weeks update on my website.
        </p>

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>May 29 - June 4</p>
        <p>
        <b>What did you do last week?</b>
            <br>
        I finalized my project idea, posted my proposal in Piazza and created a personal website.
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to complete the first two sections of my Java course (listed below) and set up my coding environment.
        <blockquote>
            1. Introduction, Installation and Environment Setup [51m]  
            <br>
            2. Basic Constructs of Java Programming [1hr 16m]
        </blockquote>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
        Time. I am in another class this semester that has a long first lab due and and exam next week, I'm hoping to carve out time to focus on this project before the weekend.
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
        I decided to use VS Code instead of a basic text editor for my HTML updates - it is much more efficient. 
        </p>

    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <p>June 5 - June 11</p>
        <p>
        <b>What did you do last week?</b>
            <br>
        I completed the first two sections of my Java course and set up my coding environment (IntelliJ IDEA).
        <blockquote>
                1. Introduction, Installation and Environment Setup [51m]  
                <br>
                2. Basic Constructs of Java Programming [1hr 16m]
        </blockquote>

        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to complete the next two sections of my Java course.
        <blockquote>
                3. Object and Classes [43m]
                <br>
                4. Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation [1hr 26m]
        </blockquote>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
        Time again, my other course is proving to be exteremely time consuming. I'm currently on track to completeing 2 sections a week, will adjust if needed.
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
        I split up my Java lectures throughout last week, which caused me to bounce back and forth between class assignments. I'm going to try to work on one class at a time this week to see how that impacts my ability to stay organized and improve time management. 
        </p>

    <h2>Week 4 </h2>
    <p>June 12 - June 18</p>
        <p>
        <b>What did you do last week?</b>
            <br>
        I completed the following two sections of my Java course.
        <blockquote>
                3. Object and Classes [43m]  
                <br>
                4. Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation [1hr 26m]
        </blockquote>

        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to complete the next two sections of my Java course.
        <blockquote>
                5. Array, Static, Final, Interface [1hr 17m]
                <br>
                6. Wrapper Class, String, StringBuilder, Access Modifier [1hr 27m]
        </blockquote>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
        Time, but I have found 2 sections a week to be a manageable pace. 
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
        I saved my lectures for the weekend last week and I think I will continue to work on this schedule, it allowed me to complete both sections in one sitting rather than split throughout the week.
        </p>

    <h2>Week 5 </h2>
    <p>June 19 - June 25</p>
    <p>
        <b>What did you do last week?</b>
            <br>
        I completed the following section of my Java course.
        <blockquote>
                5. Array, Static, Final, Interface [1hr 17m] 
        </blockquote>

        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to complete the next sections of my Java course that I didn't get to last week.
        <blockquote>
                6. Wrapper Class, String, StringBuilder, Access Modifier [1hr 27m]
        </blockquote>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
        Time. Last week was the first week that I wasn't able to complete two sections, with an exam and a long lab upcoming in my other class I'm anticipating this week will be similar.  
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
            I plan to complete one section this week to accommodate for the increase in time spent in my other course. I will attempt 2 courses again next week. 
        </p>

        </blockquote>
        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to complete the next few sections of my Java course.
        <blockquote>
                7. Collection Framework and Generics [52m]
            <br>
                8. Exception and Exception Handling [55m]        
        </blockquote>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
            Time will continue to be an issue but I feel confident that I will remain on track to begin my project in the next few weeks. 
            <br>
            <br>
        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>    
            Last week was a longer section than the last 4 on my list, I'm planning to take advantage of that and continue to complete 2 sections a week.

    <h2>Week 7 </h2>
    <p>July 3 - July 9</p>
    <p>

        </blockquote>
        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>    
        I plan to complete the last two sections of my Java course before the capstone project.
        <blockquote>
                9. Multithreading, Synchronization, and Garbage Collection [33m]
            <br>
                10. File Handling, Serialization and Deserialization [39m]     
            </blockquote>
        <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
            <br>
            Not at the moment, I'm currently on track to begin my capstone project next week.

        <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
            <br>

        </blockquote>
        <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
            <br>

    <h2>Week 9 </h2>
    <p>July 17 - July 23</p>
    <b>What did you do last week?</b>
        <br>
        I reviewed my capstone projet overview, this project consists of creating a bookstore application for authors and customers to buy and sell books.
        I created a sequence diagram and class diagram to organize the classes, functions, and code needed for this application.
        I also updated my website with project information, see my <a href="https://maes2069.github.io/menu/capstone.html">Capstone Project</a> page for details. 
            <br>
            <br>

    <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
        <br>  
        I plan to begin writing code for my project, which will include creating all of the Packages and Classes needed.
        <br>
        <br>

    <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
        <br>
        No.
        <br>
        <br>
    
    <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
        <br>    
        After reviewing the scope of the project, I am confident that I can split up the work needed between the last few weeks of class. 
    </p>
        
    <hr>
    <h2>Week 10 </h2>
    <p>July 24 - July 30</p>
    <b>What did you do last week?</b>
    <br>
        I began writing code for my project, which included creating all of the Packages and Classes needed based on the sequence and class diagrams created last week.
        <br>
        <br>

    <b>What do you plan to do this week?</b>
        <br>  
        I plan to continue writing code for my bookstore app.
        <br>
        <br>

    <b>Are there any impediments in your way?</b>
        <br>
        No.
        <br>
        <br>

    <b>Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?</b>
        <br>    
        Going through the classes and packages last week took less time than I anticipated, this puts me in a good position to complete the capstone project this week or next.
